            "What makes something a piece of literature, while another piece isn’t? All we know is that literature is all complicated in a specific way. So who decides what is literature? Literary scholars, critics and reviewers, and the market all play their role.",
            "Literary arguments concern what works are part of a certain tradition. “The Call of the Wild” by Jack London was part of English Literary Studies in the USSR because of its societal criticism, but wasn’t to be found in American syllabi. Many great disputes of who is and isn’t literary have occurred around John Milton and John Donne. Milton was considered universally praiseworthy until he was attacked by T.S. Elliot. He championed Donne and his conversational style.",
            "_The Canon Wars_ concern the push for including women, black, and immigrant authors in literature syllabi. This launched a slew of protests around American Universities on both parties in the issue around the mid-nineties. When ACTA was asked to look into whether or not dropping the Shakespeare requirement was indeed a trend, they could twenty-three out of seventy of the universities studied still required Shakespeare. Some consider this appalling, since they consider Shakespeare essential to the English Literary Tradition. Bruce Smith, English Professor at Georgetown, says that the “Major Authors” requirement, including Shakespeare, prevented room in the curriculum for women and minority authors. Upon release the requirement, Georgetown was subject to student protests and lots of media coverage, primarily from right-wing organizations and student groups. The media coverage given to the issue may function out of a public desire to return to the old value system. All this reveals that our definition of literature, and essential literature, is far from universally accepted, and even further from being unchanging.",

            "1. Familiarity or learnedness with classical texts (~1450 - )",
            "2. Writing or producing a book/word (~1660 -)",
            "3. A body of literary works made in a certain region/period (1711 -), or a work of lasting merit (1850 -)",
            "4. A body of works on a certain subject (~1790 -)",
            "5. Leaflets, pamphlets to promote products or inform (~1850 -)",
            "This is important, because it points out how “literature” has always been changing. It’s about where we get the third meaning of literature that a new market arises for novels, and heck, that novels even became a thing! Before this novel-market, literature needed patronage to be funded and produced. People looked for a place of imagination and fantasy to escape the increasingly cold, rational world they inhabited. So people not only sought good books, but books that were good in a very particular way — hence, where we get literature today.",
            "So why study literature? Because literary works are human achievements of wit and creativity, and studying literature gives us insight into the intricacies of writing and the effective use of words.",
            "The _Russian Formalists_ asserted that literary criticism must be highly structured and systemic, and that literary studies shouldn’t focus on *literature*, but *literariness*: what makes something literary. This was the beginning of modern literary criticism. Tools for the toolbox:",
            "_Literary Theory_: A way of thinking systematically and explicitly about what literature is and the methods we use in analyzing and criticizing it. Modern literary theory has typically been stimulated by importing ideas from other disciplines into the study of literature."

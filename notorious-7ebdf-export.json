            "What makes something a piece of literature, or what is the nature of being literary? No one knows for sure.",
            "What makes something a piece of literature, while another piece isn’t? All we know is that literature is all complicated in a specific way. So who decides what is literature? Literary scholars, critics and reviewers, and the market all play their role.",
            "Literary arguments concern what works are part of a certain tradition. “The Call of the Wild” by Jack London was part of English Literary Studies in the USSR because of its societal criticism, but wasn’t to be found in American syllabi. Many great disputes of who is and isn’t literary have occurred around John Milton and John Donne. Milton was considered universally praiseworthy until he was attacked by T.S. Elliot. He championed Donne and his conversational style.",
            "_The Canon Wars_ concern the push for including women, black, and immigrant authors in literature syllabi. This launched a slew of protests around American Universities on both parties in the issue around the mid-nineties. When ACTA was asked to look into whether or not dropping the Shakespeare requirement was indeed a trend, they could twenty-three out of seventy of the universities studied still required Shakespeare. Some consider this appalling, since they consider Shakespeare essential to the English Literary Tradition. Bruce Smith, English Professor at Georgetown, says that the “Major Authors” requirement, including Shakespeare, prevented room in the curriculum for women and minority authors. Upon release the requirement, Georgetown was subject to student protests and lots of media coverage, primarily from right-wing organizations and student groups. The media coverage given to the issue may function out of a public desire to return to the old value system. All this reveals that our definition of literature, and essential literature, is far from universally accepted, and even further from being unchanging.",
            "The word “literature” itself has had a storied history. It’s meant:",
            "1. Familiarity or learnedness with classical texts (~1450 - )",
            "2. Writing or producing a book/word (~1660 -)",
            "3. A body of literary works made in a certain region/period (1711 -), or a work of lasting merit (1850 -)",
            "4. A body of works on a certain subject (~1790 -)",
            "5. Leaflets, pamphlets to promote products or inform (~1850 -)",
            "This is important, because it points out how “literature” has always been changing. It’s about where we get the third meaning of literature that a new market arises for novels, and heck, that novels even became a thing! Before this novel-market, literature needed patronage to be funded and produced. People looked for a place of imagination and fantasy to escape the increasingly cold, rational world they inhabited. So people not only sought good books, but books that were good in a very particular way — hence, where we get literature today.",
            "So why study literature? Because literary works are human achievements of wit and creativity, and studying literature gives us insight into the intricacies of writing and the effective use of words.",
            "The _Russian Formalists_ asserted that literary criticism must be highly structured and systemic, and that literary studies shouldn’t focus on *literature*, but *literariness*: what makes something literary. This was the beginning of modern literary criticism. Tools for the toolbox:",

        "3 Russian Formalism" : {
          "null" : [
            "Recall that the Formalists put the emphasis of literary criticism on _literariness_. Why did this idea only originate with the Russians? In the times of the Formalists, there were giant political pressures that would eventually lead to two revolutions — the first deposing its absolute monarchy, the second installing Communism. So, plenty of people, including artists, called for revolutionary change, and published manifestos. The most popular of these was “A Slap in the Face of Public Taste”, by the Futurists. They expressed discontent with the status quo of poetry and endeavoured to make new poetry out of new words. This was avant-garde art, which intentionally aimed to disrupt the status quo and change people’s world views. This shift even empowered painters to think of paintings less as representations of the world, but more as representations of the power of their own medium.",
            "The Futurists issues a pamphlet called, “The Word as Such”, which called for people to “explore the world” beyond its ordinary meaning. It’s in this context that Victor Shklyovsky made his greatest essays — he shared the Futurists’ zeal for revolution. He shared his own manifesto, “The Resurrection of the Word”, at a Futurist hangout cafe.",
            "In it, Shklyovsky talked much about how language and individual words lost its metaphorical or descriptive quality. If we are to sense the form of words, we have to slow our perception of words — to understand how words mean. He said, “The fate of the works of old artists... is exactly the same as the fate of the word itself. They are completing the journey from poetry to prose.” So, no longer a way to understand language, but to receive meaning.",
            "So, literariness isn’t a property that certain texts have forever, but rather is an effect that they can impose upon us to reconsider what the language we’re receiving even means.",
            "Although it isn’t really worthwhile to study the Futurists’ work, it’s certainly interesting to study an English approximation to their efforts: e e cummings.",
            "In, “anyone lived in a pretty how town,” e e cummings deliberately manipulates language to make us pay attention, to force us to make out the story. For instance, he puts ‘anyone’ in the place of where a person’s name would usually go, to indicate the subject of this poem being an average, ordinary person. He often imitates a child’s speech. He also uses ‘autumn winter spring summer’ as a way of saying, ‘year in and year out’.",
            "What makes Cummings interesting: he uses the grammar and vocabulary of children, and introduces it as a new, avant-garde approach to poetry. This new literary technique isn’t Cummings’ invention, it’s a repurposing of a type of language that’s always been there.",
            "Shklyovsky’s manifesto lead him to meet other students, specifically linguistics students. This lead him to believe that literature was just a special use of language, and to borrow concepts from other fields. Later, in ‘Art as Technique’, he expands upon the ideas of his manifesto and creates a new theoretical concept: defamiliarization: the making of something strange and difficult from something that had before been too easy. Unlike others, he seeks to apply this to both poetry and prose.",
            "How do we defamiliarize events and stories? Shklyovsky advocated strongly for a visible narrator who used new manners of description to depict familiar things, but we can also accomplish a similar effect by changing the order of events, or by making some events not understood by the audience until the end of the story, and perhaps never!",
            "From the malleability of event structure, the Formalists created the terms plot for the prose events as they are presented to the reader, and story for prose events as they occurred chronologically. Motivation is the justification for artistically distorting the events in such a way that the reader would perceive them as natural.",
            "So, the literariness of a work isn’t in its message, or how it communicates this message, but the degree to which it defamiliarizes. Other critics would disagree with Shklyovsky on this point. But we all agree that this should be a part of art. In this way, the content of a work means less than its techniques employed.",
            "So! Altogether, literary theory focusses on literariness, which has value because it forces us to sense the form of words. The method of literary criticism is the evaluation of techniques. So, now we have new tools for the toolbox:",
            "Defamiliarization: what the Formalists believed literature accomplished — it should make familiar things strange to us.",
            "Technique: the means by which literature defamiliarizes the world.",
            "Motivation: the justification the text provides for the use of a technique.",
            "Story: the series of events as they might be in real life.",
            "Plot: how the events of the plot are deformed in the text.",

          "null" : [
            "Paul de Man claims that literary theory go underway when we started to use linguistic terminology when talking about literature, especially synchronic linguistics, as opposed to historic linguistics. The basic unity to this theory is the sign and the sign-system.",
            "Why the fuss about linguistics? Because it had a big impact on the work of literary critics, and in general, this shift hugely impacts not only how we think of literature and language, but all species of study. This formed Structuralism, which clerkly dominated literary theory ever since — and it all came from one guy: Ferdinand de Saussure.",
            "Saussure was moved to thing of the philosophy of linguistics, because he was so dissatisfied with current terminology in philology, the linguistics of his days. He was convinced that words were composed of something more than just sounds — since words of a language weren’t just sounds, they were meaningful sounds, and no current Philologist had a solid understanding of where the meaning came from. Saussure was convinced that this meaning could only come from sounds in a language system.",
            "So, what counts in a language isn’t just sounds, but contrasts and organizations of sounds. Humans can make a large variety of sounds, but not all will count as meaningful in a given language. We should note that within speakers of the same language, there are many differences in pronunciation — in effect, the same “word” could be composed of entirely different sounds. What matters, then, isn't sound, but contrasts of sounds. As Saussure said, “in language, there are only differences.”",
            "When we acquire language, we learn that system of contrast, not the historical background of words. So, the system is synchronic. Also note that this means that, as meaning is generated from ‘differences’ of sound, so too are meanings composed of contrasts of smaller meanings. Just as every language organizes sounds in its own way, every language organizes meanings in its own way. Think of how English lacks the plural/formal second personal pronoun, which other European languages how (i.e. vous in French). To make up for it, we’ve invented “y’all” in slang! Which is quite funny, because “you” originally was the plural second-person pronoun! So all in all, the basic unit of meaning is defined in relation to other sounds, and that meaning is shifting all the time.",
            "Saussure saw his Philology as so insufficient that he himself made terminologies for what he saw as the fundamental units of language. A sign was the union of the sound-pattern and the meaning — a meaningful unit of language. He called the sound-pattern the Signifier, and the meaning/concept the Signified. By this, he hoped to expand this system beyond language, but to all things which, in some way, contain meaning.",
            "Then the meaning of signs is forged through convention — green means go because we’ve all said it means go. So the language system is ‘social’ and is held together by nothing but our collective agreement. Yes, they change continually, but no one person can make them change.",
            "This system in is the background — what we actually encounter is sentences, which string together meanings that make sense together. He called the actual sentences of speech Parole and the language system itself Langue. He called these strings of signs Syntagmata, or Syntagm singular. Syntagmata don’t have to be sentences: “dogs” is a syntagm, since it strings together “dog” and “s” to pluralize.",
            "Associative Relations are the relations between a particular sign and the other signs we can compare it to. Like how “anti-drugs” relates to “anti-Communist” and “anti-immigration” tells us that “anti-“ means “against”. This is part of how language changes.",
            "Sometimes the sound drifts and not the meaning. Example: “undecem”, the Latin word for eleven (derived from “un” meaning “one”, and “decem” meaning “ten”), drifted to “onze” in French for the same concept. This shifted the term from being relatively arbitrary to completely arbitrary. Sometimes we fit foreign words to suit syntagms that we’re familiar with. This demonstrates that the history doesn’t matter, and it’s only the system that determines the meaning. This broadened to become the field of Structuralism. Tools:",
            "Sign — Signifier/Signified: the units of a system are signs. A sign is defined its place in the system. It is made up of two parts: a signifier and the signified. A signifier can be a written pattern, a combination of graphic symbols, or a sound pattern. The signified is the meaning that is bound to the pattern.",
            "Synchronic - Diachronic: the language system is synchronic, it exists at a moment in time: it is meant to represent what we know when we use language, and in this respect it is different from the history of a language, its diachronic aspect, which is interesting, but irrelevant.",
            "Syntagmatic - Paradigmatic (Associative): When we encounter language it takes the form of syntagmata, liner strings of signs like sentences. The elements of the syntagm are defined as associative relations, which we will call paradigmatic relations."

            "Let’s turn to the study of folklore in Russia. Towards the 20th century, this study became more intense and focussed mostly on historical analyses of folktales — but Vladmir Propp was having none of it. In “The Morphology of the Folktale”, he analyzed hundreds of folktales to argue that they were all telling, more or less, the same story.",
            "He argued that each action in the narrative could be embodied in several different ways. So though the structure of the story remained constant, its particular implementation varied. He called the fundamental units of this structure functions: “the act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action.”",
            "Thus, the character’s actions didn’t have inherent meaning, but had meaning because of its role in the system of narrative. This also means that stories are composed of functions, not characters. It was only when Claude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes noticed the similarity between Propp and Saussure that we finally got Structuralist Analysis. Woo!",
            "Barthes argues that narrative events/characters have meaning by virtue of their place in a system.",
            "A function is an event with consequences for the progress of the narrative. The most high-consequence ones among these are cardinal functions, whereas those that don’t have an impact on the narrative, usually left there for realism, are catalyzers. We call strings of functions sequences.",
            "Not everything is a function, though. There are also indices which relate to a higher level in the text (e.g. telling us more about a character or an event). These are categorized into true indices which tell us things of consequence, and informants which are of no real consequence.",
            "Yet it would be a mistake to think that all stories are just long sequences. Barthes argued that functions are integrated into Actions — large-scale stuff like quest, or struggle. These Actions are played out by actants. Above this is the layer of narration. Tools:",
            "Actions: these are the large-scale events that define the narrative as a whole. Actions are typically characterized in abstract, large-scale terms: struggle, quest, and so on.",
            "Actants: the agents necessary to an action. For example, a quest must have a subject, and a quester who quests for the subject. A struggle must involve two actants in a struggle. So actants are defined in relation to a particular action. An Actant isn’t necessarily only a single character, and a character may have two actantial roles.",
            "Function: events that lead to something else in the narrative, or follow up on something before it. Functions usually pose a risk of some kind.",

            "Catalyzers: small-scale events that fill in the space between cardinal functions, but are not essential for the progress of the narrative",

            "When Saussure build his theory, he aimed to scientifically explain why and how language worked — not to evaluate one language as better than another. He made it a descriptive, not evaluative field.",
            "So, when Structuralism took off, it couldn’t tell you whether one narrative was better than another. Strictly speaking. It can certainly tell you how a narrative works, though.",
            "Think of the narratives in “A Scandal in Bohemia”. We have Watson tell the tale of a disguised Holmes getting injured, going into the house, then Watson throwing a smoke bomb. Holmes re-narrates the events later to clarify that he had gotten injured so as to fool Adler into revealing the location of the photograph. Finally, we have Adler re-narrate all these events again from her letter, where she reveals that she out- deveined Holmes by perceiving his ruse. Each new narrative makes “Scandal” interesting as it unfolds — the narrative meaning of all the events are revealed as time goes on.",
            "So, Structuralism doesn’t necessarily have “Plot and Story” — new influences on Structuralism such as Genette introduced “Narrative and History”. Totally different, of course. But for now we’ll keep using “Plot and Story” in the Formalist sense.",

            "* External anachronisms are descriptions of events that take place outside the occurrence of the story. For example, the King’s description of his affairs with Adler would be an external anachronism, because those events occur outside “A Scandal in Bohemia”",
            "* Internal anachronisms are out-of-order descriptions of events that take place within the occurrence of the story. For example, Adler’s letter to Sherlock.",
            "Within internal anachronisms, Genette adds a final dichotomy:",

Note: this isn’t necessarily all “description” sections in story — only the times where story time is “paused”.",
            "* Ellipsis: time is “skipped” in the plot. Ex. the archetypical “Two weeks later...”, or when Watson and Holmes depart, the it’s cut to when they meet at the flat the next day.",

He was aware that an author could sneakily claim that something would be iterative, but in fact make it singulative by providing the detail of a singulative episode. Ex. “Every Friday, I’d go out for a beer with Paul and he’d tell me all about his girlfriend and how he was getting along with his classes. Most often, he’d pleasantly describe...”",

            "Saussure created synchronic linguistics in Switzerland, which Barthes picked up in Egypt, and combined into this wild soup of ideas in Paris. That’s where Jacques Derrida picks it up. He was an immigrant from a French colony, and had trained to be a philosopher. He created Deconstructionism in the 1960’s as a kind of confrontation between Structuralism and philosophy. He critiqued both classes of ideas.",
            "Derrida believed that philosophy had to swallow how Structuralism described the language that allowed for reasoning and argumentation. Philosophy often focussed on removing ambiguity in ideas — if aimed for a perfectly ‘practical’ language which perfectly expressed truth and reasoning.",
            "Structuralism came at thing from a totally different view, but it still had places where Saussure was inconsistent — Derrida thought Saussure’s conceptions were foreclosed upon in his writings to prevent the realization of their radical implications. Derrida coins the term “Differance” to express how the ‘meaning in difference’ was always deferred to further differences to find its real meaning.",
            "Derrida said that we usually assume Differance ends when we reach a sign that isn’t a reference to another sign — this he called ‘the transcendental sign’.",
            "Yet Saussure never said anything of this sort. In the beginning of his text, he goes on a tirade against writing as an artificial representation of spoken word. Writing, he said, has usurped the spoken word in the world of academics — and that mistakes have been made because of it.",
            "The end result is that the signifier alters the signified — what he calls ‘the monstrosities’! He demotes the dignified under the signified here — yet that contradicts what he says later, about how they are equal!",
            "Derrida’s response to this is interesting. He suggests that, despite Saussure’s tirade against writing as a monstrosity, writing itself was a language — one that deconstructs the heritage it was based upon.",
            "Derrida went on to practice Deconstructionism in philosophy, politics, and history, against those who thought of writing as a monstrosity or an intrusion. He thought that these texts were quite revealing. He also thought that in order to change meaning, you had to impress yourself into the pressure points of a language.",
            "That’s why Derrida called it “Deconstructionism”; these changes of language, and rearrangements of texts — an author would make new avenues, the close them off before they got too dangerous. Derrida claimed to find what the text really seemed to say, then express this as ‘the logic of the supplement.’",
            "He began analyses in finding instabilities, inconsistencies, or ‘metaphysical opposition’ in the texts. Either this or an ‘undecidable’.",
            "Readers were sometimes not only baffled by what Derrida argued, but how he argued it. His claim of philosophy and structuralism, the consequences were that you didn’t only choose your signifiers. The signified is always already in the position of the signifier! The links between signifiers were of the utmost importance. Remember how Shklyovsky argued how all words were tropes? Derrida’s thoughts run along the same lines. So his work seemed to claim that to criticize something you had to work in the text’s links of signifiers.",
            "Derrida also seemed to believe that analyzing texts as a “structure” or series of structures was like reducing the text to an abandoned city. So, he believed that he did not make the structure into an image by his new analytic technique, but rather “resurrected” the text.",
            "Some complain that Derrida unjustly makes all texts in this manner literature. This is somewhat fair. Derrida himself claimed that literature is where we find Differance dealt with most explicitly, so it’s the most intense. What does it mean to deconstruct literature? To find, expose, and undermine these oppositions or the undecideable.",

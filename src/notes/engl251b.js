                    'This is important, because it points out how “literature” has always been changing. It’s about where we get the third meaning of literature that a new market arises for novels, and heck, that novels even became a thing! Before this novel-market, literature needed patronage to be funded and produced. People looked for a place of imagination and fantasy to escape the increasingly cold, rational world they inhabited. So people not only sought good books, but books that were good in a very particular way — hence, where we get literature today.',

                    'Recall that the Formalists put the emphasis of literary criticism on literariness. Why did this idea only originate with the Russians? In the times of the Formalists, there were giant political pressures that would eventually lead to two revolutions — the first deposing its absolute monarchy, the second installing Communism. So, plenty of people, including artists, called for revolutionary change, and published manifestos. The most popular of these was “A Slap in the Face of Public Taste”, by the Futurists. They expressed discontent with the status quo of poetry and endeavoured to make new poetry out of new words. This was avant-garde art, which intentionally aimed to disrupt the status quo and change people’s world views. This shift even empowered painters to think of paintings less as representations of the world, but more as representations of the power of their own medium.',
                    'The Futurists issues a pamphlet called, “The Word as Such”, which called for people to “explore the world” beyond its ordinary meaning. It’s in this context that Victor Shklyovsky made his greatest essays — he shared the Futurists’ zeal for revolution. He shared his own manifesto, “The Resurrection of the Word”, at a Futurist hangout cafe.',
                    'In it, Shklyovsky talked much about how language and individual words lost its metaphorical or descriptive quality. If we are to sense the form of words, we have to slow our perception of words — to understand how words mean. He said, “The fate of the works of old artists... is exactly the same as the fate of the word itself. They are completing the journey from poetry to prose.” So, no longer a way to understand language, but to receive meaning.',
                    'So, literariness ins’t a property that certain texts have forever, but rather is an effect that they can impose upon us to reconsider what the language we’re receiving even means.',
                    'Although it isn’t really worthwhile to study the Futurists’ work, it’s certainly interesting to study an English approximation to their efforts: e e cummings.',
                    'In, “anyone lived in a pretty how town”, e e cummings deliberately manipulates language to make us pay attention, to force us to make out the story. For instance, he puts ‘anyone’ in the place of where a person’s name would usually go, to indicate the subject of this poem being an average, ordinary person. He often imitates a child’s speech. He also uses ‘autumn winter spring summer’ as a way of saying, ‘year in and year out’.',
                    'What makes Cummings interesting: he uses the grammar and vocabulary of children, and introduces it as a new, avant-garde approach to poetry. This new literary technique isn’t Cummings’ invention, it’s a repurposing of a type of language that’s always been there.',
                    'Shklyovsky’s manifesto lead him to meet other students, specifically linguistics students. This lead him to believe that literature was just a special use of language, and to borrow concepts' +
                    'from other fields. Later, in ‘Art as Technique’, he expands upon the ideas of his manifesto and creates a new theoretical concept: defamiliarization: the making of something strange and difficult from something that had before been too easy. Unlike others, he seeks to apply this to both poetry and prose.',
                    'How do we defamiliarize events and stories? Shklyovsky advocated strongly for a visible narrator who used new manners of description to depict familiar things, but we can also accomplish a similar effect by changing the order of events, or by making some events not understood by the audience until the end of the story, and perhaps never!',
                    'From the malleability of event structure, the Formalists created the terms plot for the prose events as they are presented to the reader, and story for prose events as they occurred chronologically. Motivation is the justification for artistically distorting the events in such a way that the reader would perceive them as natural.',
                    'So, the literariness of a work isn’t in its message, or how it communicates this message, but the degree to which it defamiliarizes. Other critics would disagree with Shklyovsky on this point. But we all agree that this should be a part of art. In this way, the content of a work means less than its techniques employed.',
                    'So! Altogether, literary theory focusses on literariness, which has value because it forces us to sense the form of words. The method of literary criticism is the evaluation of techniques. So, now we have new tools for the toolbox:',

                    'Paul de Man claims that literary theory go underway when we started to use linguistic terminology when talking about literature, especially synchronic linguistics, as opposed to historic linguistics. The basic unity to this theory is the sign and the sign-system.',
                    'Why the fuss about linguistics? Because it had a big impact on the work of literary critics, and in general, this shift hugely impacts not only how we think of literature and language, but all species of study. This formed Structuralism, which clerkly dominated literary theory ever since — and it all came from one guy: Ferdinand de Saussure.',
                    'Saussure was moved to thing of the philosophy of linguistics, because he was so dissatisfied with current terminology in philology, the linguistics of his days. He was convinced that words were composed of something more than just sounds — since words of a language weren’t just sounds, they were meaningful sounds, and no current Philologist had a solid understanding of where the meaning came from. Saussure was convinced that this meaning could only come from sounds in a language system.',
                    'So, what counts in a language isn’t just sounds, but contrasts and organizations of sounds. Humans can make a large variety of sounds, but not all will count as meaningful in a given language. We should note that within speakers of the same language, there are many differences in pronunciation — in effect, the same “word” could be composed of entirely different sounds. What matters, then, isn\'t sound, but contrasts of sounds. As Saussure said, “in language, there are only differences.”',
                    'When we acquire language, we learn that system of contrast, not the historical background of words. So, the system is synchronic. Also note that this means that, as meaning is generated from ‘differences’ of sound, so goo are meanings composed of contrasts of smaller meanings. Just as every language organizes sounds in its own way, every language organizes meanings in its own way. Think of how English lacks the plural/formal second personal pronoun, which other European languages how (i.e. vous in French). To make up for it, we’ve invented “y’all” in slang! Which is quite funny, because “you” originally was the plural second-person pronoun! All in all, the basic unit of meaning is defined in relation to other sounds, and that meaning is shifting all the time.',
                    'Saussure saw his Philology as so insufficient that he himself made terminologies for what he saw as the fundamental units of language. A sign was the union of the sound-pattern and the meaning — a meaningful unit of language. He called the sound-pattern the Signifier, and the meaning/concept the Signified. By this, he hoped to expand this system beyond language, but to all things which, in some way, contain meaning.',
                    'Then the meaning of signs is forged through convention — green means go because we’ve all said it means go. So the language system is ‘social’ and is held together by nothing but our collective agreement. Yes, they change continually, but no one person can make them change.',
                    'This system in is the background — what we actually encounter is sentences, which string together meanings that make sense together. He called the actual sentences of speech Parole and the language system itself Langue. He called these strings of signs Syntagmata, or Syntagm singular. Syntagmata don’t have to be sentences: “dogs” is a syntagm, since it strings together “dog” and “s” to pluralize.',
                    'Associative Relations are the relations between a particular sign and the other signs we can compare it to. Like how “anti-drugs” relates to “anti-Communist” and “anti-immigration” tells us that “anti-“ means “against”. This is part of how language changes.\n',
                    'Sometimes the sound drifts and not the meaning. Example: “undecem”, the Latin word for eleven (derived from “un” meaning “one”, and “decem” meaning “ten"), drifted to “onze” in French for the same concept. This shifted the term from being relatively arbitrary to completely arbitrary. Sometimes we fit foreign words to suit syntagms that we’re familiar with. This demonstrates that the history doesn’t matter, and it’s only the system that determines the meaning. This broadened to become the field of Structuralism. Tools:',
                    'Sign — Signifier/Signified: the units of a system are signs. A sign is defined its place in the system. It is made up of two parts: a signifier and the signified. A signifier can be a written pattern, a combination of graphic symbols, or a sound pattern. The signified is the meaning that is bound to the pattern.',
                    'Synchronic - Diachronic: the language system is synchronic, it exists at a moment in time: it is meant to represent what we know when we use language, and in this respect it is different from the history of a language, its diachronic aspect, which is interesting, but irrelevant.',
                    'Syntagmatic - Paradigmatic (Associative): When we encounter language it takes the form of syntagmata, liner strings of signs like sentences. The elements of the syntagm are defined as associative relations, which we will call paradigmatic relations.'

                    'Let’s turn to the study of folklore in Russia. Towards the 20th century, this study became more intense and focussed mostly on historical analyses of folktales — but Vladmir Propp was having none of it. In “The Morphology of the Folktale”, he analyzed hundreds of folktales to argue that they were all telling, more or less, the same story.',

So though the structure of the story remained constant, its particular implementation varied. He called the fundamental units of this structure functions: “the act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action.”',
                    'Thus, the character’s actions didn’t have inherent meaning, but had meaning because of its role in the system of narrative. This also means that stories are composed of functions, not characters. It was only when Claude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes noticed the similarity between Propp and Saussure that we finally got Structuralist Analysis. Woo!',

The most high- consequence ones among these are cardinal functions, whereas those that don’t have an impact on the narrative, usually left there for realism, are catalyzers. We call strings of functions sequences.',

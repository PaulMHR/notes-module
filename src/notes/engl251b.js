                    '2. Writing or producing a book/word (~1660 -)\n' +

                    '5. Leaflets, pamphlets to promote products or inform (~1850 -)',
                    'This is important, because it points out how “literature” has always been changing. It’s about where we get the third meaning of literature that a new market arises for novels, and heck, that novels even became a thing! Before this novel-market, literature needed patronage to be funded and produced. People looked for a place of imagination and fantasy to escape the increasingly cold, rational world they inhabited. So people not only sought good books, but books that were good in a very particular way — hence, where we get literature today.',
                    'So why study literature? Because literary works are human achievements of wit and creativity, and studying literature gives us insight into the intricacies of writing and the effective use of words.',

                    'Recall that the Formalists put the emphasis of literary criticism on literariness. Why did this idea only originate with the Russians? In the times of the Formalists, there were giant political pressures that would eventually lead to two revolutions — the first deposing its absolute monarchy, the second installing Communism. So, plenty of people, including artists, called for revolutionary change, and published manifestos. The most popular of these was “A Slap in the Face of Public Taste”, by the Futurists. They expressed discontent with the status quo of poetry and endeavoured to make new poetry out of new words. This was avant-garde art, which intentionally aimed to disrupt the status quo and change people’s world views. This shift even empowered painters to think of paintings less as representations of the world, but more as representations of the power of their own medium.',
                    'The Futurists issues a pamphlet called, “The Word as Such”, which called for people to “explore the world” beyond its ordinary meaning. It’s in this context that Victor Shklyovsky made his greatest essays — he shared the Futurists’ zeal for revolution. He shared his own manifesto, “The Resurrection of the Word”, at a Futurist hangout cafe.',
                    'In it, Shklyovsky talked much about how language and individual words lost its metaphorical or descriptive quality. If we are to sense the form of words, we have to slow our perception of words — to understand how words mean. He said, “The fate of the works of old artists... is exactly the same as the fate of the word itself. They are completing the journey from poetry to prose.” So, no longer a way to understand language, but to receive meaning.',
                    'So, literariness ins’t a property that certain texts have forever, but rather is an effect that they can impose upon us to reconsider what the language we’re receiving even means.',
                    'Although it isn’t really worthwhile to study the Futurists’ work, it’s certainly interesting to study an English approximation to their efforts: e e cummings.',
                    'In, “anyone lived in a pretty how town”, e e cummings deliberately manipulates language to make us pay attention, to force us to make out the story. For instance, he puts ‘anyone’ in the place of where a person’s name would usually go, to indicate the subject of this poem being an average, ordinary person. He often imitates a child’s speech. He also uses ‘autumn winter spring summer’ as a way of saying, ‘year in and year out’.',
                    'What makes Cummings interesting: he uses the grammar and vocabulary of children, and introduces it as a new, avant-garde approach to poetry. This new literary technique isn’t Cummings’ invention, it’s a repurposing of a type of language that’s always been there.',
                    'Shklyovsky’s manifesto lead him to meet other students, specifically linguistics students. This lead him to believe that literature was just a special use of language, and to borrow concepts' +
                    'from other fields. Later, in ‘Art as Technique’, he expands upon the ideas of his manifesto and creates a new theoretical concept: defamiliarization: the making of something strange and difficult from something that had before been too easy. Unlike others, he seeks to apply this to both poetry and prose.',
                    'How do we defamiliarize events and stories? Shklyovsky advocated strongly for a visible narrator who used new manners of description to depict familiar things, but we can also accomplish a similar effect by changing the order of events, or by making some events not understood by the audience until the end of the story, and perhaps never!',
                    'From the malleability of event structure, the Formalists created the terms plot for the prose events as they are presented to the reader, and story for prose events as they occurred chronologically. Motivation is the justification for artistically distorting the events in such a way that the reader would perceive them as natural.',
                    'So, the literariness of a work isn’t in its message, or how it communicates this message, but the degree to which it defamiliarizes. Other critics would disagree with Shklyovsky on this point. But we all agree that this should be a part of art. In this way, the content of a work means less than its techniques employed.',
                    'So! Altogether, literary theory focusses on literariness, which has value because it forces us to sense the form of words. The method of literary criticism is the evaluation of techniques. So, now we have new tools for the toolbox:',

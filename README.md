# notes-module
A React-based web application designed to display class notes in an intuitive, readable, and hypertextual manner.

I've still got a long ways to go to implement my original design, but you can try running the application yourself to see for yourself what I'm working on! To grab a fresh version of the repository and run, use

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulMHR/notes-module.git
cd notes-module
npm install # install all the modules the app needs that you don't have
npm start   # host the site at http://localhost:3000
```

If you already have a local copy of this module on your computer, you can update and run the site using

```$xslt
cd notes-module
git pull origin master
npm install
npm start
```

If you ever notice any problems with this (that aren't simply things not being done yet!) feel free to leave me an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
